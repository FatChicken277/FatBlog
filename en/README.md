### Hi, my name is Alejo ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a full-stack software developer with experience working with Golang, Vuejs, Python, C, Bash scripting, and Git, also I would like to mention my experience working with teamwork and agile methodologies such as scrum.

I am a graduate student from Holberton School where I carried out several vital projects in backend, frontend, and DevOps.

I am a creative person who likes to bring new ideas, work in a team, have a clean work environment, and learn new things every day.



**Interests:**

* Cybersecurity & Pentesting
* Cloud services
* DevOps
* Docker & Kubernetes

**Fun facts about me:**

* I enjoy making unnecessary scripts
* I love to customize everything ([proof](https://twitter.com/aleejo\_rc/status/1521295322382753796))
* I like to draw when I get inspired
* FatChicken277 came up while I was creating an account to play GTA V Online
